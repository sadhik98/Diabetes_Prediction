**LinkedIn** : https://www.linkedin.com/in/sadhikbasha/

**Problem Statement:**

1.) The "Diabetes Prediction and Deployment with Streamlit Application" aims to provide a complete ML-based solution to detect diabetic risk based on patient data.

2.) This project handles end-to-end preprocessing, model training, and deployment of the best model using cloud infrastructure.

3.) By deploying the model on AWS EC2 with a Streamlit interface, the project enables scalable and real-time health prediction.

**Features**

Data Cleaning & Imputation: Handle missing values and clean the dataset using Pandas.

Model Training & Evaluation: Apply and compare Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models.

Model Serialization: Save the best-performing model (XGBoost) with 97% accuracy using Pickle.

Cloud Deployment: Host the model with a user interface using Streamlit on AWS EC2.

**Tools**

Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Pickle, Streamlit, AWS EC2, NumPy

**Approach**

Python: Used for scripting the complete ML pipeline and integration.

Pandas/NumPy: For data analysis, cleaning, and transformation.

Scikit-learn & XGBoost: For building and evaluating classification models.

Pickle: Used to serialize the best model (XGBoost) for deployment.

Streamlit: To build an interactive UI for real-time predictions.

AWS EC2: Cloud hosting of the app to make the prediction model accessible online.

**Findings**

Findings → Achieved 97% accuracy using XGBoost; deployed the complete system on AWS for real-time diabetes risk prediction, demonstrating the practical utility of ML in healthcare diagnostics.

**Prerequesting Library**
→ All required libraries and environment setup details are documented in the diabetesModelRequirements.txt file.
